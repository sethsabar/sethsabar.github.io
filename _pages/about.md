Hi, my name is Seth Sabar and I'm a sophomore at Brown Univeristy studying pure math and computer science. In my free time, I like to workout, play sports, or pretty much anything active. Click [here](https://sethsabar.github.io/publications/) to see research I've done or [here](https://sethsabar.github.io/projects/) to see some projects I'm working on.
