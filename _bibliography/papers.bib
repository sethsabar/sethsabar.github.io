  title  = {Hurwitz Orbits of Equal Size},
  abstract = {We provide a variety of cases in which two factorizations have Hurwitz orbits of the same size. 
  We begin with prototypical results about factorizations of length two, and show that cycling elements or flipping 
  and inverting elements in any factorization preserves Hurwitz orbit size. We prove that "double reverse" 
  factorizations in groups with special presentations have Hurwitz orbits of equal size, and end with applications to 
  complex reflection groups.},

  abstract = {We show that in the complex reflection group {$G_6$}, reflection factorizations of a Coxeter 
  element that have the same length and multiset of conjugacy classes are in the same Hurwitz orbit. 
  This confirms one case of a conjecture of Lewis and Reiner.},
